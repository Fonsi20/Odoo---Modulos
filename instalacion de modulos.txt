To install our modules in Odoo after making the Scaffold we have to unzip them,
if it is in ZIP format, and put it in one of the folders of the Addoms route 
like: Odoo / Server / Odoo.conf

If our version is 11.0+ we follow the following steps:

- Activate developer mode
- Navigate to Apps menu
- Click Update Apps List
- Search and open a module you need
- Click [Install]
